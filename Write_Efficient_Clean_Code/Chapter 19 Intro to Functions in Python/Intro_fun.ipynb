Functions that you write for specific tasks can be used over and over, without needintg to redefine the function again. A function that you write for one Python workflow can also be reused in other workflows!\n",
    "- Fewer variables: When you run a function, the intermediate variables (i.e. placeholders) that it creates are not stored as explicit variables unless you specify otherwise. This saves memory and keeps your Python environment cleaner.\n",
    "- Better documentation: Well-documented functions help other users understand the steps of your processing and helps your future self to understand previously written code.\n",
    "- Easier to maintiain and edit your code: Because a function is only defined once in the workflow, you can simply just update the original function definition Then, each instance in which you call that function in your code (i.e. when same task is performed) is automatically updated.\n",
    "- Testing: You won't learn about this in this class, but writing functions allows you to more easily test your code to identify issues (i.e. bugs)."
